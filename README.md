 Overview

This project demonstrates the visualization of sales data using a horizontal bar chart. The chart helps in comparing sales values across different categories or time periods. The initial chart was cluttered with overlapping labels and axis values, which affected its readability. This repository focuses on improving the presentation and clarity of the chart.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided in the SALES.xlsx file. It contains sales values for different categories, which are visualized using a bar chart.

Visualization

The bar chart visualizes the sales data with categories on the Y-axis and sales amounts on the X-axis. Each bar represents the sales value for a specific category. The chart currently has some layout and readability issues, which will be addressed through visualization improvements.
